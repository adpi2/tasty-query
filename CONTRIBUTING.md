## Tools Needed To Begin
The following tools can be installed following our [Scala getting started guide](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html):
- JVM 1.8+
- [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)

A text editor is also useful, we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [Metals IDE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals).

## Testing the setup
To test that everything is working, you can run the tests. In a terminal, navigate to the directory of this project and use the command:
```script
sbt test
```
